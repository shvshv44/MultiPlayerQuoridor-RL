# MultiPlayerQuoridor-RL

Our project is to program an algorithm based on a neural network. It will play “The Quoridor Game” against one/two/three other players (Human or AI) and will try to win every game. 

The training process of the algorithm will be self training, meaning it will create and play games versus itself and become better and better every game. 

Moreover, In our project we will develop an app. It will provide a multiplayer option to allow the user to play with other players (friends or AI) in the same game. It will also save all the games in MongoDB so the users will be able to see their past games.
